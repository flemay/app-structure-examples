# Package structure

If the file(s) containing your grouped code are really large, or you've considered breaking one large file into a few smaller ones all still related to the same group of code, then it might be time to introduce packages to your structure. ðŸ™‚

Packages are exactly that - a way to group all code related to one well-defined functionality into a single directory.
You can have as many files as you need in a single package, but having the directories is a nice way to visually group related files together. 

This structure is great for:
- beginners who are starting to use packages (without having a specific application structure pattern in mind)
- simple projects/apps which benefit from having packages to improve their readability and understandability
