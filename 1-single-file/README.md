# Single-file structure 

Aka all your code is in one file called `main.go`. ðŸ™‚

This structure is great for:
- beginners who don't want to worry about how to split their code into files or packages just yet
- super simple projects/apps which don't require more than a single file

I cannot stress enough that this structure is **absolutely fine** for simple or quick scripts which don't need to be perfect! 
Most of my Advent of Code answers for example, or at least the first few "easy" days all tend to get solved in a single file.
Don't feel like you "have to have" multiple files or packages. Go's premise is to keep things as simple as possible but no simpler, so don't add complexity for no reason!
