# Multi-file structure

Aka your start to group related code into separate files. The structure of your project remains flat otherwise - all  files live next to each other in a single top-level directory. ðŸ™‚

This structure is great for:
- beginners who are just starting to figure out how to group related functionality together
- simple projects/apps which don't require more than a few files

Note that there's no right or wrong here - I could have just one file called `calorie_calculator.go` which would also contain the input parsing function, or I can have two files as in the example. Whatever works for your use case and helps you organise your code best (while keeping things simple)!
